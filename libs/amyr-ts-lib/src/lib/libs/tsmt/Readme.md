# TYPESCRIPT MATH TOOLKIT

The TypeScript Math Toolkit (TSMT) is a continuation of the _JavaScript Math Toolkit_ created by Jim Armstrong in the 2014-2016 time frame.  Other than classical data structures, it consists primarily of software targeting mathematical (numerical) operations.

TSMT folder structure is documented below. (C) means that code in that folder is complete, meaning on par with the ADT (Angular Dev Toolkit).  (N) means that new content beyond that existing in the ADT has been added to the folder. (P) means partial content (relative to the ADT).  (E) means the folder is currently empty, i.e. ADT code has yet to be moved into _AMYR_.  That requires some more coffee!!
