# AMYR Core Library

This folder contains files common to multiple areas of the AMYR library.

The _core_ folder structure is documented below. (C) means that code in that folder is complete, meaning on par with the ADT (Angular Dev Toolkit).  (N) means that new content beyond that existing in the ADT has been added to the folder. (P) means partial content (relative to the ADT).  (E) means the folder is currently empty, i.e. ADT code has yet to be moved into _AMYR_.  That requires some more coffee!!

- drawing (dynamic drawing) - E
- **easing (easing equations) - C**
- shapes (virtual drawing of various shapes) - E
